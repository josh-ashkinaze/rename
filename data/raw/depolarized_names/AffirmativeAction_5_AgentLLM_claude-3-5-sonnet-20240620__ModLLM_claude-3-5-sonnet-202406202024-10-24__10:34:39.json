From where I'm standing, it just don't seem fair to everyone. \n\nI mean, I'm busting my behind working part-time and raising kids, trying to make ends meet. And then I hear about folks getting special treatment just 'cause of their background? That don't sit right with me.\n\nLike, what about my kids? They're gonna have to compete for college spots and jobs someday. Are they gonna lose out to someone who might not have worked as hard, just 'cause of some policy?\n\nAnd another thing - doesn't this whole deal kinda make people feel like they can't make it on their own? Like they need a handout or something? That don't seem right to me. We should all have the same shot, you know?\n\nPlus, I've heard it can cause tension at work and school. People wondering if someone got in 'cause of their skills or just to fill a quota. That ain't good for nobody.\n\nI get that folks wanna help people who've had it rough, but this just seems like it's causing more problems than it's fixing. There's gotta be a better way to level the playing field without all this fuss.", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"}], "persona": "Your age is 27. Your education is no hs credential.
