From where I'm standing, it feels like they're trying to create more division.\n\nI mean, I care about the environment and all, but why do we have to make everything about justice these days? It's like they're implying that if you're not 100% on board with their ideas, you're somehow against fairness or something. That's not cool.\n\nPlus, I've got my own stuff to worry about - classes, working part-time, trying to figure out what I'm gonna do after college. I don't have time to get all worked up about every little environmental issue that comes up. \n\nAnd let's be real, some of these environmental regulations can make things more expensive or complicated for regular people. Like, what if they decide to ban certain types of cars or make gas prices go up even more in the name of \"justice\"? That would make it harder for me to get around or afford things.\n\nI just think we should focus on practical solutions that don't pit people against each other. Maybe talk about keeping our neighborhoods clean or finding ways to save energy that don't cost an arm and a leg. But this whole \"Environmental Justice\" thing? It feels like it's more about pushing an agenda than actually helping people or the environment.", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"}], "persona": "Your age is 21.
