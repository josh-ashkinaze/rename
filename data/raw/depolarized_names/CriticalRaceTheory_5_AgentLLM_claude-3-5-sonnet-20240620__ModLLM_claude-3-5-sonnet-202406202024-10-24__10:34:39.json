Honestly, it feels like it's being blown way out of proportion. I mean, I get that we need to talk about race and inequality, but it seems like this phrase is just being used to rile people up.\n\nFrom what I understand, some of the specific objections I have are:\n\n1. It's making everything about race when there are other factors at play too. Like, what about socioeconomic status or family background?\n\n2. It feels like it's pitting people against each other instead of bringing us together. We're all Americans, right? Why do we need to focus so much on our differences?\n\n3. I'm worried it might make white students feel guilty for things they didn't do. I don't think that's fair or helpful.\n\n4. It seems like it's being pushed into schools without much input from parents or local communities. Shouldn't we have more say in what our kids are learning?\n\n5. The way it's being talked about, it sounds like it's trying to rewrite history. I think we should learn about the good and bad parts of our past, but not in a way that makes it seem like everything was terrible.\n\n6. I'm concerned it might lead to some kind of reverse discrimination. Like, are we going to start favoring certain groups over others just to make up for past wrongs?\n\nLook, I think we need to address racial issues, but this whole Critical Race Theory thing just seems like it's causing more problems than it's solving. Can't we find a less divisive way to talk about this stuff?", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"}], "persona": "Your age is 24. Your education is 4-year degree. Your gender is woman.
